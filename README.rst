Stock Scores
============

Stock Scores is a python script to score stocks based on specified
criteria. The goal of this project is to provide a powerful stock scoring
system for various types of stock classifications (growth, momentum, value, etc.).

Similar to how one might rank the best options when they are deciding
where to go to dinner, Stock Scores lets investors choose what screens
they want to run. Then, this script takes care of the rest,
showing which stocks performed best under the given tests.
