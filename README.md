# Stock Scores
Stock Scores is a python script to score stocks based
on specified criteria. The goal of this project is to
eliminate unnecessary filtering by providing a powerful
stock score system.

Similar to how one might rank the best options when they
are deciding where to go to dinner, Stock Scores lets investors
choose what criteria they value and how much they value each
criterion. Then, this script will take care of the rest, showing
which stocks performed best under corresponding tests.
